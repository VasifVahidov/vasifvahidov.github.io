                # Frequency of purchase per week
                frequency_per_week = np.array([3, 7, 2, 5, 1])

                # Calculate weekly expenses
                weekly_expenses = prices * frequency_per_week

                # Calculate total weekly expense
                total_weekly_expense = np.sum(weekly_expenses)

                # Calculate monthly expenses (assuming 4 weeks in a month)
                monthly_expenses = total_weekly_expense * 4

                # Print out the results
                print(f"Weekly Expenses: ${total_weekly_expense:.2f}")
                print(f"Monthly Expenses: ${monthly_expenses:.2f}")

                # Create a DataFrame for plotting
                data = pd.DataFrame({

                plt.tight_layout()
                plt.show()

                # Use Seaborn's style to enhance the plot
                sns.set(style="whitegrid")

                # Enhanced bar chart
                plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
